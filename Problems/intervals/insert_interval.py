"""
You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals
"intervals" where intervals[i] = [start-i, end-i]
represent the start and the end of the ith interval
and intervals is sorted in ascending order by start-i.
You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end]
that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals
is still sorted in ascending order by start-i and
intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals
(merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return intervals after the insertion.

Note that you don't need to modify intervals in-place.
You can make a new array and return it.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]],
newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps
with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
